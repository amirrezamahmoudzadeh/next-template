                    The first line of defense in data security is the informed

                    ensuring the security of all data, regardless of format.
                    Such behaviors include those listed in this section as well
                    as any additional requirements specified in the employee
                    handbook, specific security processes, and other applicable

                    that has been approved for corporate use by Userback may be
                    installed on corporate equipment. All personnel must read
                    and understand the list of prohibited activities outlined in
                    this Policy. Modifications or configuration changes are not

                    Personnel may not configure work devices to make backups or
                    copies of data outside corporate policies. Instead,
                    personnel are expected to operate primarily “in the cloud”
                    and treat local storage on computing devices as ephemeral.
                    Userback data must be saved to company-approved secure cloud
                    storage (e.g. Google Docs) to ensure that even in the event
                    of a corporate device being lost, stolen, or damaged, such
                    artifacts will be immediately recoverable on a replacement
                    device.

                    these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job
                    responsibilities (e.g. planned penetration testing, systems
                    administration staff may have a need to disable the network
                    access of a host if that host is disrupting production

                    Each individual having access to any Userback-controlled
                    system does so via a G Suite user account denoting their
                    system identity. Such user accounts are required to have a
                    unique username, a unique strong password of at least 8
                    characters, and a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism.

                    Logins by personnel may originate only from Userback-managed
                    devices. Authentication is performed by Google’s account
                    management system, details of which can be found at
                    https://gsuite.google.com/security. Userback leverages G
                    Suite’s facilities of detecting malicious authentication
                    attempts. Repeated failed attempts to authenticate may
                    result in the offending user account being locked or
                    revoked.
